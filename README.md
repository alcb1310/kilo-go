# KILO - GO

## Description

This is my attempt to recreate the `KILO` editor in `Go`.

Reference to this project: [Kilo Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)

We will go through all the steps, from entering raw mode to editing text with syntax highlighting.

## Installation

This project currently will work only in `Linux`, if you are using `Windows` or `MacOS` you will have to make some changes in the code, feel free to create a pull request.

To install this project run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alcb1310/kilo-go.git
cd gokilo
go build
